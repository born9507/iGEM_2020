            <p>As one of the team leaders, Clara completed most of the administrative tasks, such as registering the team with the school and meeting the iGEM competition requirements. She was also a part of the biology team, engaging in the design and coding processes to create the most appropriate biosensor model. As a part of the Human Practices team as well, she organized meet-ups with other Korean teams and international organizations such as the Dream Space Academy, a pivotal organization that helped the team get in touch with the local community in Sri Lanka. </p>

            <p>Jinha as one of the team leaders took responsibility for administrative tasks along with collaboration with other teams in Korea, notably KUAS. Furthermore, as part of the biology team, Jinha took responsibility for the coding process for creating the biosensor model as well as the wiki. Also taking a major role in the proposed implementation, he actively researched possible, realistic applications of the biosensor model around the world, contacting with various key figures and organizations for the end goal of providing a cheap yet effective way of detecting contaminated wheat. Overall, he has enjoyed actively participating in the team!</p>

            <h3>Other iGEM Teams</h3>
            <h4>KUAS</h4>
            <p>KUAS is a collegiate iGEM team in Korea run by college students of Korea University. With each member ranging in interest and skill, some of them being biotechnology, life science, design, and nursing, KUAS has been successful in its endeavors throughout its years of participation in the iGEM competition. Developing their know-how over the years, KUAS has been kind enough to assist other high school teams in Korea by sharing their experiences and taking part in partnerships, one of such teams being ours, SIS_Korea. </p>

            <h3>Meet Up</h3>
            <h4>KUAS</h4>
            <p>In late June, our iGEM team met with the KUAS team, seeking guidance and their know-how on the igem competition. In particular, by asking questions on specific criterias for the medals in IGEM, we were able to choose which criterias would be appropriate to focus on considering our topic: human practices and engineering success. Furthermore, the KUAS team was kind enough to challenge and criticize our idea of using an e coli and a biosensor to detect contaminated wheat, raising the major concern of whether our purpose of detection would be actually applicable to saving wheat. Through an interactive session, discussing freely on their project and our project, both teams were able to make immense progress and conclusively, we decided to take part in a partnership through which we will continue to find other areas of collaboration.</p>
