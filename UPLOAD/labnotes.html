            <div>
              We started to email professors of different fields for Interviews. We were able to meet one professor offline and we learned more about the different appropriate enzymes and genes that we could use and the harms and benefits of E-Coli.

            <div>
              KUAS helped us by sharing their past iGEM experience and giving us feedback on our project idea so far.
            </div>
            <div>
              We also had email/online interview meetings with Aravinth Panch, the co-founder and director of innovation of the DreamSpace Academy. We interviewed Panch in order to assess the scale of the problem local to Sri Lanka and also to figure out how reasonable our current project was in terms of goals.

              Korea_HS team contacted us and asked if we were willing to collaborate. We decided on a day and met up with Korea_HS and KSA_Korea. We each shared and presented each of our topic and synthetic biology processes and gave/received feedback and questions that helped all of us understand.

            <div>
              We reached out to another expert on the fields of agriculture and biosensor. Mr. Kim Ki Young is an agricultural researcher in the Rural Development Administration, an expert in the field of agricultural food post-harvest management, also very familiar with the concept of implementing biosensors to tackle this post-harvest management issue. He informed us on the cautions when designing and creating a mycotoxin biosensor.

              On September 14th, our team hosted an online Zoom seminar for high school students and staff in our school to learn more about the post-harvest situation in Sri Lanka and our biosensor design (targeted for Sri Lanka) addressing the issue. After we presented our slides, we also had a Q&A session afterwards in which the students gained deeper insight of professional concepts such as the E.coli producing the CYP1A2 enzymes along with professional terms like enzymes and genes.

              On September 16th, we sent out a survey through DreamSpace Academy. They helped us gather multiple respondents so we could garner ample information from different people regarding the agricultural system and technology in post-harvest in Sri Lanka.

              On October 10th, we had a meeting with Ross Bundy, the co-founder of a biosensor company, Cardea Bio, that was willing to help us towards the end of our project. Considering the short amount of time left, he suggested sending us resources and relevant materials to further our understanding of our hardware. He also advised us on the protocol of our project to make up for a more practical use.
