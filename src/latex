The aim here is to model the possible inter-woven effects of the three
environmental factors on fungal infection of stored rice. Suppose that a
researcher has collected data of the environmental factors and fungal
infections, $\{x_{n},y_{n}\}_{n=1}^{N}$, from $N$ samples of stored rice
obtained across different storage places as well as over different time
periods. Here, $x_{n}=(m_{n},t_{n},l_{n})^{^{\prime}}$ denotes moisture
content ($m_{n}$), temperature ($t_{n}$), and storage length of time ($l_{n}$)
of rice sample $n$ ($n=1,...,N$). In addition, $y_{n}$ indicates fungal
infection mesure of the rice sample $x_{n}$. Then, our modeling take here is
to capture a relationship between $x_{n}$ and $y_{n}$:%
\begin{equation}
y_{n}=f(x_{n})+\varepsilon_{n},\text{ }n=1,\ldots,N,\label{general_y}%
\end{equation}
where $f(\cdot)$ is an unknown regression function that we wish to estimate
and $\varepsilon_{n}$ is an error term with mean 0. The regression function
$f$ gives the predictive relationship of an $N$-dimensional response vector
$y=(y_{1},\ldots,y_{N})^{^{\prime}}$ on an $N\times3$ design matrix
$x=(x_{1}^{^{\prime}},\ldots,x_{N}^{^{\prime}})^{^{\prime}}$, i.e. the
conditional expectation of $y$ given $x$, $E(y)=f(x)$. Then, if $f$ is
estimated and available, it is straightforward to use the function $f$ to
predict a value of $y_{N+1}$ given a new, environmental design variable
$x_{N+1}\notin x.$

In this study, the function $f$ is not fixed in a parametric form (e.g., a
linear function with unknown parameters $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)$,
$f(x_{n})=\alpha m_{n}+\beta t_{n}+\gamma l_{n}$. Specifically, $f$ is
presumed to be unknown completely so that $f$ itself is a unknown parameter to
be estimated. In particular, the function is going to be estimated
nonparametrically without any constraints on its functional shape. In the
statistics literature, a large number of nonparametric regression models have
been developed for the estimation of unknown function $f$ in a flexible,
adaptive way (cf. Takezawa 2005). In this study, the function $f$ is estimated
non-parametrically on the basis of multivariate adaptive regression spline
(MARS) model (Denison et al. 1998; Friedman 1991, 1993).

Suppose that the whole data domain $x$ is partitioned into $K$ distinct
sub-domains: $x_{1}^{p},\ldots,x_{K}^{p}$. Then, $f$ can be represented by a
partition regression model as follows:%
\begin{equation}
f=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\theta_{k}B_{k}(x),\label{partitioned}%
\end{equation}


where $\theta_{k}$ and $B_{k}(x)$ denote, respectively, regression coefficient
and basis function associated with the $k$-th partition, $x_{k}^{p}$. In the
MARS model, the partitions have two-level hierarchy structure along with
interactions and knots -- detailed discussions follow.

Let $\#(x)$ denote the total number of columns in $x$, i.e. the total number
of explanatory variables -- for example, $3$ in our study. Let $d=R(x)$
denotes the number of relevant explanatory variables in $x$; here, relevant
explanatory variables denote those which have non-zero effects on $y$. The
values of $d$, therefore, range from $0$ to $\#(x)$; the value $d=0$ indicates
that all explanatory variables in $x$ show zero-effects on $y$, and $d>1$
means that $d$ explanatory variables exhibit non-zero effects while others do
not affect $y$. Note that the number of possible configurations of design
matrix varies across different values of $d$: specifically, the number of
$d$-combination of explanatory variables is $\binom{\#(x)}{d}$, that is the
binomial coefficient. For example, in our study, there are three distinct
subsets of $x$ for $d=1$: $m=(m_{1},\ldots,m_{N})^{^{\prime}}$, $t=(t_{1}%
,\ldots,t_{N})^{^{\prime}}$, and $l=(l_{1},\ldots,l_{N})^{^{\prime}}$.

Next, each of the first level partitions of $x$, $x_{1}^{p1},\ldots
,x_{K1}^{p1}$, defined across different values of $d$, is further divided into
several sub-partition along with the second level variable, knots. In the MARS
model, the knot configurations -- the numbers and the locations of knots --
are also unknown parameters to be estimated; specifically, knot configurations
may differ across the first level partitions $x_{1}^{p1},\ldots,x_{K1}^{p1}$
as well as across $R(x_{k}^{p1})$ explanatory variables in $x_{k}^{p1}$,
$k=1,\ldots,K1$. Finally, the second-level partitions become the final $K$
distinct partitions $x_{1}^{p},\ldots,x_{K}^{p}$. Then, the MARS model
formulates the basis function as follows:%
\[
B_{k}(x)=\left\{
\begin{array}
[c]{c}%
1,\text{ if }\#(x_{k}^{p})=0,\\%
%TCIMACRO{\dprod \limits_{i=1}^{\#(x_{k}^{p})}}%
%BeginExpansion
{\displaystyle\prod\limits_{i=1}^{\#(x_{k}^{p})}}
%EndExpansion
\left[  s_{k,i}\times(x_{k,i}^{p}-\tau_{k,i})\right]  _{+},\text{ otherwise,}%
\end{array}
\right.
\]
where $a_{+}=\max(0,a)$ is a truncation operator, $x_{k,i}^{p}$ denotes the
$i$-th element ($i=1,\ldots,\#(x_{k}^{p})$) of $x_{k}^{p}$, $s_{k,i}%
\in\{1,-1\}$ is the sign for $x_{k,i}^{p}$, and $\tau_{k,i}$ is a split, knot
point for $x_{k,i}^{p}$. Note that the knot configurations $\{\tau_{k,i}\}$
may vary across different partitions as well as across different explanatory
variables in a given partition.

It is clear that $B_{k}(x)$ captures only an intercept term if $\#(x_{k}%
^{p})=0$. If the value of $\#(x_{k}^{p})$ is one, then only one element of
$x_{k}^{p}$ has a non-zero main effect. In particular, when the value of
$\#(x_{k}^{p})$ is greater than one, $\#(x_{k}^{p})$ elements of $x_{k}^{p}$
exhibit a $\#(x_{k}^{p})$-way interaction effect. Therefore, it is easy to
realize that the first level partition $\{x_{k}^{p1}\}$, corresponds to
interaction effects. Given a particular partition at the first level, the
partition $\{x_{k}^{p1}\}$ can be further divided into sub-partitions across
different knot configurations $\{\tau_{k,i}\}$: note that $\tau_{k,i}$ is a
unknown parameters to be estimated. Therefore, it is easy to see that the MARS
have a two-level partition structure. Finally, in the MARS model, all the
unknown parameters to be estimated are $\{\{\theta_{k}\},\{s_{k,i}%
\}_{i},\{t_{k,i}\}_{i}\}_{k}$.\

\section{Empirical Applications}

The proposed MARS model is is fitted to a real data set in order to examine
possible joint effects of three environmental factors on fungal infection of
stored rice.

\subsection{Data}

The effects of moisture content, temperature, and storage periods on fungal
infection are empirically examined in a nonparametric way by fitting the MARS
model to laboratory data of paddy rice reported in Abdel-Hafez et al (1992)'s paper.

Their published data contain, in total, $N=48$ observations of environmental
factors and fungal infection scores across various levels of three
environmental factors -- see Table \ref{TAB_Data}. In addition, fungal
infection scores, measured as the count of propaglues of fungi per 1 mg dry
grain, are attained by using the popular dilution-plate method (cf.
Christensen 1963).

\subsection{Model Comparison}

The MARS model is fitted to the Abdel-Hafez \textit{et al} (1992)'s data by
using the earth package for R posted at the CRAN repositories,
https://mirror.rcg.sfu.ca/mirror/CRAN/. R, available at
https://www.r-project.org/, is a free software for statistical computing. The
statistical software R has come into prominence due to its flexibility as an
efficient language that builds a bridge between software development and data
analysis. Through the use of the earth package, we may avoid unnecessary
tedious, technical difficulties involved in the estimation task of the MARS
model, and focus on inferences on research questions.

Because we have three environmental variables, the possible orders of
interactions range from $0$ to $3$. Table \ref{TAB_ModelComp} gives model
performance results across different configurations of interaction effects.
Residual sum-of-squares (RSS) denotes the summed values of squared errors in
total in the data, where error is the absolute value of difference between
observed and predicted fungal infection scores given values of three
environmental factors. R-square measure, defined as 1 -- RSS/TSS, is designed
to measure how well the model fits the training data, where TSS denotes total
sum-of-squares of fungal infection scores, the summed values of squared
deviations of fungal infection scores from the sample average. Therefore,
model becomes more favorable in terms of model fit as RSS decreases and
R-square increases.

Among three competing MARS models, interaction-effect modes, $M_{2}$ and
$M_{3}$, perform non-trivially better than the main-effect model, $M_{1}$.
Therefore, moisture content, temperature, and storage length of time affect
fungal infection of stored rice jointly rather than mutually independently,
implying that these three environmental factor should be monitored and
controlled as a set, opposed to separate items, for the purpose of minimizing
the hazard of fungal infection of stored rice. The most preferred one among
three competing MARS models is $M_{3}$, the one capturing three-way
interactions probably along with other low-order effects such as main and
two-way interactions, suggesting that fungal infection may be minimized
through joint optimization of moisture content, temperature, and storage
length of time as a whole set.

\subsubsection{Estimation Results for the Most Preferred Model, $M_{3}$}

Estimates of all the unknown parameters of $M_{3}$, $\{\{\theta_{k}%
\},\{s_{k,i}\}_{i},\{t_{k,i}\}_{i}\}_{k}$, are given in Table
\ref{TAB_Estimates}. Table \ref{TAB_Estimates} contains only basis functions
found to have significant, non-zero effects, and all the other basis functions
that are not reported in Table 3 therefore show zero effects. In $M_{3}$,
non-zero meaningfull main effects are found only for moisture content with a
knot position 17, implying that main effect curve of moisture content may be
non-linear. Note that response function becomes a linear function only when
knot does not exist. In addition, significant non-zero two-way interactions
are found for pairs of (i) moisture content and temperature, $\{m,l\}$ , and
(ii) temperature and storage length of time, $\{t,l\}$. Finally, three-way
interactions are significant in four sub-partitions: $\{m,t,\{l_{n}%
\}_{l_{n}<2}\},$ $\{m,t,\{l_{n}\}_{l_{n}\geq2}\},\{\{m_{n}\}_{m_{n}%
<17},t,l\},$and $\{\{m_{n}\}_{m_{n}\geq17},t,l\}$. More critically, all of
these significant two- and three-way interaction basis functions have knots
for a subset of three environmental factors, suggesting that interaction
effects may have highly curved surface opposed to flat planes.

Fig. \ref{FIG_SURF} presents the estimated curved surface of moisture content
and temperature across different storage length of time. It is evidently clear
that surface of moisture content and temperature on fungal infection is not
flat but highly curved regardless of storage lengths. Further detailed
discussions on major findings follow. Hereafter, $f(v|w)$ denotes conditional
function of $v$ on fungal infection given a value of $w$. For example, Fig.
\ref{FIG_SURF} presents surface plots of joint conditional function of
moisture content and temperature given storage length of time, i.e.
$f(m,t|l)$.

First, conditional effects of moisture content given temperature and storage
length of time are non-linear. Examinations on estimated response function of
moisture content conditional on temperature and storage length of time,
$f(m|t,l)$, show that all the conditional functions of moisture content are
kinked. In particular, the conditional functions of moisture content are
kinked singly and doubly, respectively, for $l=l$ and $l>1$. Fig.
\ref{FIG_CondMC} gives estimated conditional response function of moisture
content, $f(m|t,l=1)$ and $f(m|t,l=4)$. As shown in Fig. \ref{FIG_CondMC}-(b),
when storage length of time is four months, all the conditional functions of
moisture content $f(m|t,l=4)$ seem to be kinked at moisture content of $17\%$,
although $f(m|t=8%
%TCIMACRO{\U{b0}}%
%BeginExpansion
{{}^\circ}%
%EndExpansion
$C$,l=4)$ is relatively flat -- see the knot estimate for moisture content,
17\%, in Table \ref{TAB_Estimates}; this suggest that (i) if moisture content
is lower than the knot 17\%, fungal infection rates remain low and flat
regardless of temperature, (ii) if moisture content exceeds the knot position,
fungal infection increases with an increase of moisture content, and (iii)
rates of increase in fungal infection grow with an increase of temperature.
Similar results are found for storage time length of 2 and 8 months,
$f(m|t,l=\{2,8\})$ -- see Fig. \ref{FIG_SURF}. Interestingly, the conditional
response function of moisture content given temperature and fixed storage
length of one month, $f(m|t,l=1)$, is kinked singly and doubly, respectively,

Second, conditional effects of temperature given moisture content and storage
length of time vary across different values of moisture content and/or storage
length of time. Fig. \ref{FIG_CondTemp} presents estimates of two conditional
response curves of temperature, $f(t|m,l=1)$ and $f(t|m,l=4)$. Note that
estimates of $f(t|m,l=2)$and $f(t|m,l=8)$ are similar to the estimate of
$f(t|m,l=4)$ in terms of functional shapes. It is readily seen that all the
estimated conditional functions of temperature are linear except
$f(t|m\geq22.5\%,l=1)$. As shown in Fig, \ref{FIG_SURF}-(b), if storage length
of time exceeds one month, (i) fungal infection remains low and flat as long
as moisture content is rather low, (ii) fungal infection increases with
temperature increases if moisture content is rather high, and (iii) rates of
increase grow with increases of moisture content regardless of temperature.
However, when storage length of time is short (e.g., one month), (i) the
conditional curves of temperature are linear if moisture content is lower than
17\% and non-linear otherwise, and (ii) the conditional curves of temperature
for $m\succeq22.5\%$ are singly kinked -- see Fig. \ref{FIG_SURF}-(a); these
results suggest different optimal storage strategies depending upon functional
shapes of estimated conditional function of temperature: (i) temperature does
not matter if the estimated curve is flat, (ii) temperature needs to be lower
than knot temperature if the estimated curve is kinked, and (iii) temperature
should be kept as low as possible for the case of linear conditional curve. In
particular, it is important to realize moisture content should be kept as low
as possible regardless of temperature if rice is going to be stored for two
months at least. However, if rice is going to be stored for short periods of
time, say one month, the optimal value of moisture content may be 17\%
primarily because moisture content of 11.5\% may lead to higher fungal
infection than 17\% regardless of temperature.

Last, risks of fungal infection can be minimized by optimizing three
environmental variables jointly, and not separately. Fig.
\ref{FIG_CondContour} presents contour plots of $f(m,t|l=\{1,4\})$. Contour
plots of $f(m,t|l=\{2,8\}$) are omitted simply because these plots are
essentially similar to contour plot of $f(m,t|l=4)$, as discussed before. As
shown in Fig. \ref{FIG_CondContour}-(b), when rice is going to be stored for
two months at least, (i) fungal infection risk is low and flat regardless of
temperature if moisture content is sufficiently low, (ii) fungal infection
risk is low and flat regardless of moisture content if temperature content is
sufficiently low, (iii) fungal infection risk increases with an increase of
moisture content if both moisture content and temperature are high, and (iv)
fungal infection risk increases with increases of both moisture content and
temperature. These results implied in Fig. \ref{FIG_CondContour}-(b) confirm
previous discussions on conditional marginal response functions. In addition,
it is readily seen that Fig. \ref{FIG_CondContour}-(a) reconfirms all the
previous discussions on conditional marginal response functions given $l=1$.

\subsubsection{Inferences on Optimal Control of Rice Storage Environment}

\bigskip Figures \ref{FIG_SURF} to \ref{FIG_CondContour} indicate, as a set,
that the proposed MARS model may capture quite complicate interwoven, joint
effects of moisture content, temperature, and storage time length on fungal
infection risk. The estimated MARS model indeed enables one to make inferences
on optimal values of three environmental factors in order to attain certain
low level of fungal infection risk of stored rice by identifying optimal
values of moisture content, temperature, and storage time length,
$\widetilde{x}$ , by solving%
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{x}=\arg\min_{x}\widehat{f}(x),
\end{equation}
where $argmin$ is the argument operator for the minimum and $\widehat{f}$ is
the predicted fungal infection scores given environmental factor
$x=\{m,t,l\}$\}. In addition, it is possible to make various inferences on
$\widetilde{x}$  conditionally as well as jointly, as discussed and
illustrated before. For example, joint optimal values of three environmental
factors can easily be identified simultaneously as a set (e.g., optimal values
of moisture content, temperature, and storage time length) -- see figures
\ref{FIG_SURF} and \ref{FIG_CondContour}. Furthermore, it is also quite
straightforward to attain optimal values of a subset of the environmental
factors conditional on fixed level of others (e.g., optimal percentage of
moisture content when rice is going to be stored at 25$%

\section{Discussion}

All of the extant previous studies in the literature have been completely
silent on nature and characterstics of curvature of effect spaces of moisture
content, temperature, and storage length of time on fungal infection risk,
primarily because none of previous studies have addressed a flexible,
statistical model to capture interwoven effects of these three environmental
factors. In this study, we proposed a flexible nonparametric MARS model for
the purpose of empirical investigation on possible inter-dependent effects of
three environmental factors on fungal infection of stored rice. The proposed
model is fitted to a real rice storage data set. By doing so, we empirically
examined the joint response surface of moisture content, temperature, and
storage length of time on fungal infection risk. Note that none of extant
previous studies have reported, empirically and explicitly, joint response
curves of moisture content, temperature, and storage length of time on fungal
infection.

Through the real application, we demonstrated the proposed MARS model would be
flexible enough to capture quite complex joint effects of these variables on
fungal infection risk along with all the possible interactions. The proposed
model, in fact, enables one to make inferences on (i) set of relevant,
non-zero terms of terms of main and/or interaction effects of three
environmental factors on fungal infection risk along with the nature of the
effects in terms of functional shapes, curvature, and response surface, and
(ii) the joint and/or conditional optimal values of three environmental
factors to minimize the hazard of fungal infection of stored rice.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first empirical modeling study
on joint effects of moisture content, temperature, and storage length of time
on fungal infection. Furthermore, the proposed model is quite general and
flexible primarily because its applicability is not restricted to such three
factors and it can, in fact, be readily extended to accomodate even a rather
large number of environmental factors. However, all the discussions of
conditional response functions and surfaces in this study are contingent upon
on the data we used. In particular, the data set we used have only three to
four levels in rather narrow ranges for each of three environmental variables
-- see Table \ref{TAB_Data}. Therefore, a possibly fertile direction for
future research may be to fit the proposed MARS model to relatively rich data
with increases in (i) sample size of stored rice observations, (ii) the number
of explanatory environmental factors, (iii) the number of levels for each of
the environmental factors, and/or (iv) the ranges of values for each of the
environmental factors.
