          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>As much as it is important to establish a feasible and effective biological solution to address global issues, raising social awareness is vital to make actual positive change. Therefore, not only did we develop a biological design to reduce post-harvest losses in agricultural practices, but we also made efforts to increase awareness of this issue at hand. As our survey responses displayed, approximately 70% of people did not know the concept and issue of postharvest. Thus, our team decided it was our responsibility, through human practices, to first, gain important and accurate knowledge from professionals and experts, and second, share the valuable information to the general public. </p>
          <p>Firstly, our team interviewed several professors and experts on diverse fields to obtain more information and knowledge regarding the post-harvest issues (specifically in Sri Lanka) and our experimental design’s biological aspects. We interviewed (number of people)..</p>

        <div class="mainCategory" id="Campaign">
          <h2>Campaign</h2>
          <p>With the response from the survey we sent out, we found that not a lot of people were aware of the severity of the issue of post-harvest losses in agricultural practices. Therefore, campaigning was a crucial facet of our project, in which we were able to raise awareness and emphasize the degree of necessity of this global issue. </p>
          <p>In order to raise further awareness about this vital issue to a larger, more diverse scope of audience, we set up campaigns outside of our school zone. With our two educational posters and one big flyer to introduce our project, we set up in multiple subway stations.</p>
          <p>During the subway campaign, we answered any questions civilians asked. The most common question asked was for the details of our bio sensor. </p>

        <div class="mainCategory" id="Education">
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>Draft...</p>
          <p>Our team wished to encourage more students to learn about this issue; therefore, we took this process even further to educate our entire highschool. Even though our initial plan was to conduct a seminar in the auditorium for high schoolers, a brief introduction to our project along with fun and engaging activities for middle schoolers, and a simple hands-on activity for kindergartners, we were heavily restricted with the gathering we had due to the COVID 19 situation, thus, we adjusted our plans. </p>
          <p>From August xxth to the xxth, we presented the post harvest issue and our project only to SIS’s high school community in a simple manner. We created an educational and interesting video to inform students in the middle and high school about the importance of addressing a feasible, cost-friendly solution to the immense post-harvest losses that countries face around the world. (add more after the campaign is done) We also had two posters containing different information. The first one, which included data and images, had all the details regarding the local situation in Srilanka and how imperative this issue is.The second poster had a brief design of our sensor and how it will function. </p>
          <p>Students got the opportunity to learn about professional concepts such as the E.coli producing the CYP1A2 enzymes along with professional terms like enzymes and genes. Questions were answered regarding both the project and iGEM in general. </p>
          <p>Even though some high schoolers already knew about the concept of post harvest, many students showed shallow knowledge or were very indifferent to taking such actions. Thankfully, many students showed big interest in our topic and were wanting to learn more about the concept of post harvest. </p>

          <h2>Survey Analysis</h2>
          <p>About a month ago, a survey was sent out by our team, highlighting various questions we planned to ask individuals regarding the subject matter of our topic. We had such varied results of 23.3% of ~ we managed to attain a total aggregate of 176 responses.</p>
          <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c5/T--Korea-SIS--survey1.png"/>
          <p>The first question pertinent to our central discussion was about how many of the individuals who took a survey knew the country of Sri Lanka. Out of 176 responses, 164 individuals (93.2%) claimed to say that they indeed knew the country Sri Lanka while conversely, 12 individuals (6.8%) stated that they were unfamiliar with the country.</p>
          <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/c/c9/T--Korea-SIS--survey2.png"/>
          <p>The second question was about the concept of post-harvest and whether or not the responders were familiar with it. While many knew the country of Sri Lanka (as shown in the previous question), they were unfamiliar with the crisis that tormented the country. According to the responses, 122 individuals (69.3%) said that they didn’t recognize the concept of post-harvest, while on the other hand, 54 individuals affirmed that they did know the concept of post-harvest. Given this fact, it is possible to speculate that a lack of awareness on this issue is what led it to spread incessantly. </p>
          <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/4/40/T--Korea-SIS--survey3.png"/>
          <p>The third question was stated in almost a predictive manner, as we asked the responders to estimate the amount of financial loss Sri Lanka experiences from poor post-harvest technology. The results were fairly similar among the four answer choices, with 36 individuals (20.5%) predicting that 1-5 billion rupees are lost, 55 individuals (31.3%) predicting that 10-15 billion rupees are lost, 47 individuals (26.7%) predicting that 18-20 billion rupees are lost, and finally, 38 individuals (21.6%) predicting that above 100 billion rupees are lost per year. The correct amount of rupees lost is around 18 billion dollars a year, a significant amount that was predicted by 26.7% of the responders.</p>
          <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b3/T--Korea-SIS--survey4.png"/>
          <p>Our fourth question asked whether or not the solution we proposed for this experiment (fabricating a biosensor that has the capability of detecting fungi in the rice, a stimulus to post-harvest loss), seems like an adequate way to deal with this predicament. Out of the 176, 155 individuals (88.1%) stated that they had faith in our project, while 21 individuals (11.9%) believed that it was not enough to solve the status quo. This result may have been attained due to the fact many of the individuals that are being surveyed do not have sufficient information on biosensors. </p>
          <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/3/38/T--Korea-SIS--survey5.png"/>
          <p>Finally, we asked the respondees on whether or not they believe this crisis is a serious one and to place it on an urgency level of 1 to 5. 16 individuals (9.1%) stated that they saw the post-harvest loss in Sri Lanka as a situation with an urgency level of 1. Another 16 individuals (9.1%) stated that they saw the post-harvest loss in Sri Lanka as a situation with an urgency level of 2. 45 individuals (25.6%) stated that they saw the post-harvest loss in Sri Lanka as a situation with an urgency level of 3. 54 individuals (30.7%) stated that they saw the post-harvest loss in Sri Lanka as a situation with an urgency level of 4. And finally, 45 individuals (25.6%) stated that they saw the post-harvest loss in Sri Lanka as a situation with an urgency level of 1. Armed with the fact that a majority of the respondents stated that they believe this situation has a threat level of 3 or higher, we can affirm that this problem is one that needs an immediate solution and addressing, something we have done throughout the developmental process of our project. </p>
