          PROJECT GOALS
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>- To engineer a system that will detect the levels of toxins in the rice storage.</div>
          <div>- To create this system, we will mass produce Escherichia coli to produce the CYP1A2 enzyme.</div>
          <div>- To mainly combat the issue of post harvest losses.</div>

            MOTIVATION
          </div>
          <div>
            <div>The absence of a systemic storage system of rice was the most critical complication, which is why we seeked a potential solution through the iGEM project.</div>
            <div>This is not only relevant in Sri Lanka, but also in other developing countries, as rice is a major staple food, which exemplifies the urgent need to implement an effective post harvest system.</div>

          <div>CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK</div>
          <div>- We designed recombinant E.coli which express CYP1A2
            human enzyme that is required for toxin detection.</div>
          <div>- We proposed a nonparametric MARS model designed to
            capture possible inter-dependent effects of environmental
            factors on fungal infection of stored rice.</div>
          <div> We will make this system to have more efficiency and
            widely-used.</div>
          <div>- Not only commercialization but also spreading widely
            with NGOs is what we want to do with this idea.</div>
