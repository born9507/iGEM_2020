              Before we get into the actual survey itself, we must get into the reasons why we conducted these surveys in the first place. The main reason was of course to assess how many people actually knew about the problem in the first place. This was because we wanted to see just how much of an impact the introduction of a new technology would have on the storage facilities of Sri Lanka. Plus we also wanted to see if there was any work that had been done or was being done that targeted losses due to fungi.

              This question was asked to Sri Lankan rice farmers in our survey. Being arguably one of the most important questions on the survey, it was a multiple choice question between the choices: transport, storage, and selling. Out of the 44 participants, 42 farmers of varying scales of farming said that the most crop loss occurred for them in the storage process while the other 2 farmers said that it occurred in the transport stages. This result told us that the local farmers of Sri Lanka were already aware of the fact that most of the crops were being lost in the storage process after their harvest, thus telling us that we were on the right track when looking for solving problems in the post-harvest storage process.

              In our online survey that was sent to the local Sri Lankan farmers with the help of Dreamspace Academy, the main purpose was to assess the severity of the problem and also to assess how aware the farmers were on the problems they had.

            <div>
              One criteria that especially stood out in our survey results was the fact that only 5 out of 44 participants answered that they were profiting from selling crops that their farms were making. This is an abysmal number considering that these people are supposed to make a living off of their crops. This and the fact that they are losing most of their harvest due to storage issues further highlighted the importance of the issue we were tackling in our iGEM project.
            </div>
            <div>
              We must then delve deeper into just how much rice they were losing during storage and transport. To this question most farmers answered that they were losing 10~20% of their harvest during the transport/storage stage (6 out of 44 answered 20% the rest answered 10%). Even though this might seem like a small amount, it most definitely is not a small amount when we consider that these farmers had anywhere between 1~25 hectares of land. This 10% could be the number that tips the farmers over the profit threshold every year and the fact that they are needlessly throwing the rice away due to poor management is something that needs to be addressed.

              Thanks to the people at DreamSpace Academy, our team was able to get a few interviews done on Sri Lankan farmers as well. We tried to assess how well this problem of post-harvest was known amongst the victims. To the question of knowing about the term “post-harvest losses” in general, all 5 of the interviewees seem to have been somewhat aware of this element of farming in Sri Lanka. However, when it came down to knowing about where and why the losses happened, answers were varied and only some answers briefly mentioned that the bad storage mechanisms in Sri Lanka in itself was a problem. As we dug deeper, the misunderstandings of the main problem of post-harvest losses became painfully clear. Everyone was satisfied with the storage unit they currently had and only one person even brought up the wet being a danger to the harvested crops in general. Overall the farmers of Sri Lanka seemed to think that the storage unit was good enough if it had enough space and could protect against insects and rats. This result of the survey clearly shows us that crop losses due to fungi is not addressed clearly by the Sri Lankan farmers and that our project would definitely be of some help to the Sri Lankan farmers.
