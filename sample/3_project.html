            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Acute malnutrition is a major concern in Sri Lanka, a small island located under India. According to the World Food Programme, a high percentage ranging from 14 to 35 percent in 25 districts suffer from acute malnutrition, elucidating the prevalent problem in the nation. Furthermore, ranking 6th on the Climate Risk Index, Sri Lanka is highly vulnerable to climate change, which equally has devastating impacts on the agricultural yields of the nation. The nation still faces a myriad of challenges such as high rates of malnutrition. Even though agriculture accounts for only 7.87% of the entire economy, when looked at a broad aspect, the entire country except for its capital, Colombo, relies on agriculture. Despite the substantial harvest production, according to the findings of a study conducted by Chinese experts, its poor post-harvest technology leads to the loss of Rs.18 billion annually. This report has been handed over to the Minister of the Ministry of agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera, who is aware of this critical issue. This inadequate post-harvest technology has also affected the yield of rice, a staple food for 18.6 million Sri Lankans and the livelihood for 1.8 million farmers. In response to this dilemma, there has been a focus in reducing loss of crop through improving post-harvest managing system for rice. </p>

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>The prime objective of an effective post-harvest managing system should be maximizing the quality and quantity of rice to ensure the food stability and safety of Sri Lanka. This is pivotal as developing nations struggle to secure their socio-economic status, coupled with the maintenance of income amongst small rice farmers. Within the post harvest system are post harvest losses that can not be overlooked, specifically the economic losses depicted by quantitative measurements. Delving into the post-harvest system, we found out that the absence of systemic storage system of rice was the most critical complication, which is why we seeked a potential solution through the iGEM project. More egregiously, currently in Sri Lanka, the rice industry relies on indigenous techniques to manage their crop products. Through reference research, we found out that the storage structure is instrumental in protecting the quality of rice as it is susceptible to extreme temperature, moisture, and pests or fungi. Accordingly, to combat this prevalent issue in Sri Lanka, we thought to solve this problem through the utilization of the appropriate technology to control the quality and quantity of rice production. This is not only relevant in Sri Lanka, but also in other developing countries, as rice is a major staple food, which exemplifies the urgent need to implement an effective post harvest system.</p>
            <p>By synthesizing cheap and mass producible protein that we need to use for sensing the metabolites of fungi in rice, in other words, how much the rice is contaminated, we can build a management system for rice. For this, we will use the Escherchia coli(E.coli) for </p>
            <p>With an effective biosensor, we are utilizing synthetic biology for a real life issue in countries involving contamination of wheat. Not only would our application serve useful in detecting contaminated wheat but also serve as a precursor to prevention of such contamination.</p>
            <p>Our project goal is to mainly combat the issue of post harvest losses, specifically in the process of storing the rice in Sri Lanka. Especially because rice is a staple food in such developing nations, it exemplifies the urgent need to implement an effective post harvest system. The agriculture industry in Sri Lanka relies heavily on indigenous practices; the main complication is the lack of the appropriate tools and technology in the nation. More egregiously, protecting the quality of the crop is difficult as well because it is susceptible to extreme temperature and moisture levels. In order to achieve this, we will engineer a biosensor that will detect the levels of toxins in the rice to control the quality and quantity of rice production.</p>
            <p>To create this biosensor, we will mass produce E.coli to produce the CYP1A2 enzyme and attach a fluorescent tag on the enzyme for easier detection. </p>
            <p>Previous winning IGEM teams have used e coli, relating to synthetic biology, for instance, one of them decomposing plastic with their E-coli including PETase genes. With the impression that E-coli can be an effective means to address environmental problems, we were similarly motivated to search for relevant issues today, immediately being interested by the agricultural problems in Sri Lanka involving wheat. In particular, the problems amount from lack of storage and ineffective management of crops, resulting in contamination. Continuing with a follow-up research on preventing such contamination, we soon realized that contamination of wheat can be solved through controlling humidity levels, a solution method that was not difficult at all but unfeasible in that no efficient detection of wheat contamination in the public. As such, our project centers around using an e coli to detect contaminated wheat to farmers who then can respond appropriately by raising or lowering the humidity levels.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Implementation</h2>
          <p>Our proposed end users are workers of the agricultural industry in countries that are constantly plagued by the growth of fungi on rice during storage. This would include many Asians countries, whose staple food is mainly rice.</p>
          <p>I would see people using the product in storage facilities to detect decay in the grain storage to prevent further decay. For a cheap and accessible price, our ecoli will be mass produced and used as an effective marker for contaminated wheat, particularly in developing countries such as Sri Lanka that are in dire need along with a low-cost bioreceptor that can report changes to the transducer.  </p>
          <p>By making biosensors with ecoli that are easy to mass produce and transport, we would implement the project in the real world so that many people would be able to easily access our product. Many different farmers would be able to notice decay in their grain storage which would be able to salvage grain production in the countries mentioned above. It would be widely accessible.</p>
          <p>Our experiments involve chemicals for bacterial transformation, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. All of the safety measures related to these procedures are only basic lab protocols such as wearing gloves when handling chemicals and making sure to prevent any physical contact from occurring. Furthermore, since there is possible exposure to volatile liquids, dusts, and mists, we will use the clean bench and fume hood to prevent such exposure. We are not certified experts afterall in the lab; thus, we may make subtle mistakes that may endanger ourselves. </p>
          <p>We need to consider the cost of our biosensor and ecoli and whether it is relatively inexpensive for real application. We need to formulate efficient yet cheap ways that will promote our product and enable it to be widely distributed around the world. Another challenge is teaching prospective users of our ecoli/biosensor on the specific details in using it.  </p>
