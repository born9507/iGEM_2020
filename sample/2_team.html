            <h3>Final Words</h3>
            <p>Triston: Truly one of the best experiences in my entire education life! Not only did I gain comprehensive knowledge in my topic, I learned so many useful tips that can be applied to my school life and beyond! </p>
            <p>Ian: A very valuable experience where I learned how we could apply the things we learned in classrooms to real world problems. I also learned how to work together with other people, an aspect I lack in.</p>
            <p>Aiden: It was a great experience for me. Not only did I learn a lot of things, but also I became an expert in this topic. I also learned a lot of teamwork skills and improved my public speaking skills.</p>

            <h4>KUAS</h4>
            <p>KUAS is a collegiate iGEM team in Korea run by college students of Korea University. With each member ranging in interest and skill, some of them being biotechnology, life science, design, and nursing, KUAS has been successful in its endeavors throughout its years of participation in the iGEM competition. Developing their know-how over the years, KUAS has been kind enough to assist other high school teams in Korea by sharing their experiences and taking part in partnerships, one of such teams being ours, SIS_Korea. </p>

            <h3>Meet Up</h3>
            <h4>KUAS</h4>
            <p>In late June, our iGEM team met with the KUAS team, seeking guidance and their know-how on the igem competition. In particular, by asking questions on specific criterias for the medals in IGEM, we were able to choose which criterias would be appropriate to focus on considering our topic: human practices and engineering success. Furthermore, the KUAS team was kind enough to challenge and criticize our idea of using an e coli and a biosensor to detect contaminated wheat, raising the major concern of whether our purpose of detection would be actually applicable to saving wheat. Through an interactive session, discussing freely on their project and our project, both teams were able to make immense progress and conclusively, we decided to take part in a partnership through which we will continue to find other areas of collaboration.</p>
