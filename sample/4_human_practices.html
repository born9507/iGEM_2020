          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>As much as it is important to establish a feasible and effective biological solution to address global issues, raising social awareness is vital to make actual positive change. Therefore, not only did we develop a biological design to reduce post-harvest losses in agricultural practices, but we also made efforts to increase awareness of this issue at hand. As our survey responses displayed, approximately 70% of people did not know the concept and issue of postharvest. Thus, our team decided it was our responsibility, through human practices, to first, gain important and accurate knowledge from professionals and experts, and second, share the valuable information to the general public. </p>
          <p>Firstly, our team interviewed several professors and experts on diverse fields to obtain more information and knowledge regarding the post-harvest issues (specifically in Sri Lanka) and our experimental designâ€™s biological aspects. We interviewed (number of people)..</p>

          <h2>Campaign</h2>
          <p>With the response from the survey we sent out, we found that not a lot of people were aware of the severity of the issue of post-harvest losses in agricultural practices. Therefore, campaigning was a crucial facet of our project, in which we were able to raise awareness and emphasize the degree of necessity of this global issue. </p>
          <p>In order to raise further awareness about this vital issue to a larger, more diverse scope of audience, we set up campaigns outside of our school zone. With our two educational posters and one big flyer to introduce our project, we set up in multiple subway stations.</p>
          <p>During the subway campaign, we answered any questions civilians asked. The most common question asked was for the details of our bio sensor. </p>
