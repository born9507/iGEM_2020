        <p>Abstract</p>
        <p>Rice is a staple food resource in many areas in Asia. Rice should be dried and kept in proper humidity after harvest, and if the humidity is too high, it loses its merchantability and value as food due to various pathogens such as fungi. In Sri Lanka and India, however, the lack of proper management in the post-harvest storage process of rice is causing loss. Most of the fungi that occur in the post-harvest management process of rice is Aspergillus spp. 4 species. Therefore, in this study, we are trying to establish a more stringent post-harvest management system for rice by measuring the concentration of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), a toxin produced by Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus parasiticus. By constructing an E.coli, which produces CYP1A2, an enzyme required for the sensor, we tried to secure the economics of the management system.</p>
