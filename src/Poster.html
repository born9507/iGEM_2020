          <h4>Abstract</h4>
        </div>
        <div>
          Rice is a staple food for many countries in Asia. Rice needs to be dried and stored under specific conditions after harvest. If not, it loses its merchantability and affects the total yield. In Sri Lanka, it affects the livelihood of 1.8 million farmers and the lack of proper post-harvest technology is costing them 2393 million dollars annually. The fungi that are present in the storage of rice are Aspergillus spp. In this project, we establish a stringent post-harvest management system for rice by measuring the concentration of aflatoxin B1, a toxin produced by Aspergillus spp. To measure the concentration of AFB1, we used the enzyme, cytochrome P450 1A2. Reactions between AFB1 and CYP1A2 result in compounds with epoxide residue, which can be used for the detection. Here, we also proposed a nonparametric MARS model designed to capture possible inter-dependent effects of environmental factors on fungal infection of stored rice.

          To make the recombination E.coli that expresses CYP1A2, which is a human protein that we need for measuring the concentration of toxin, we had to design the CYP1A2 expression system. We searched for an appropriate vector plasmid that has multiple cloning sites(MCS) and the antibiotics resistance gene, kanamycin resistance gene, for our system. By using two restriction enzymes, EcoRI and and BamHI, and two primers, recombinant vectors that carry the CYP1A2 gene can be constructed. Then, this vector plasmid has to be taken up to the E.coli cell, especially to bacterial competent cells that have been specially treated to transform efficiently.

          • To confirm whether the vectors with CYP1A2, our target gene are transferred to E.coli cells, the resistance gene that vectors have can be used. Our vectors have a kanamycin resistance gene, so kanamycin treated media will be used to get only E.coli cells which have vectors that are carrying the target gene.

          • After that, Recombinant E.coli will be grown in conditions in 37C, and they will express the CYP1A2 protein. Protein extraction process and protein purification can help to get the enzyme, without other molecules in the total cell lysate. Now we can use the enzyme to treat the crops, which have aflatoxins measured by a spectrophotometer.

          • Our nonparametric model examines the joint effects of moisture content, temperature, and storage length with the flexibility to account for more variables in the future. Along with the optimal course of action to minimize the fungal infection, the model offers a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the join effect on fungal infection of stored rice.

          As much as it is important to establish a feasible and effective biological solution to address global issues, raising social awareness is vital to make actual positive change. Therefore, not only did we develop a biological design to reduce post-harvest losses in agricultural practices, but we also made efforts to increase awareness of this issue at hand. As our survey responses displayed, approximately 70% of our participants were not aware of the concept and issue of postharvest losses. Thus, our team decided it was our responsibility, through human practices, to gain important and accurate knowledge from professionals and experts to share valuable information to the general public.        </div>

          <strong>• ACCESIBLITY</strong> - We strived to implement the project in the real world for accessibility to the general public with partnerships with social organizations in Sri Lanka. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <strong>• WET LAB EXPERIMENT</strong> - Our experiments involve chemicals for bacterial transformation, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. All of the safety measures related to these procedures are only the basic lab protocols, such as wearing gloves when handling chemicals and making sure to prevent any physical contact. Furthermore, since there is possible exposure to volatile liquids, dusts, and mists, we will use the clean bench and fume hood to prevent such exposure. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
          <strong>• REAL APPLICATION</strong> - We need to consider the cost of our biosensor and E-coli and whether it is relatively inexpensive for application. We need to formulate efficient yet cheap ways that will promote our product and enable it to be widely distributed around the world. Another challenge is teaching prospective users of our E-coli/biosensor on the specific details.
